Hello, my name is Junior D., three words to describe myself is ambitious, hard working and loyal. 

Some of my favorite hobbies are going to the gym, traveling, video games, and anime. Going to the gym helps me stay active since 90% of my day I feel like are spent sitting down. Going to gym helps me mentally and physically, traveling is awesome to me, I love discovering and learning new things. Video games and Anime helps fuel my imagination. I can get lost in both those activites for hours. My favorite animal is a bull, and my favorite sport is basketball.
